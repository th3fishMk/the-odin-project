# The odin project

My solutions to [The odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## What is The Odin Project?

If you are not familiar with The Odin Project (Referred as TOP from now on), it is an open source community dedicated to teach WebDevelopment, and I am now making my way to become a full stack web-dev so I guess I just found my home.

As simple as that!

## Where are the projects?

All my learning (web) repos have been moved to [this organization](https://github.com/fish-devs-web) in order to keep things organized and simple. I figure organizations are something similar to folders or directories in which we can have repos. So I decided to use this function.

I named the organization [fish-devs-web](https://github.com/fish-devs-web) because I din't have any other idea, and it is pretty descriptive...

Name | code | live
--| -- | --
Recipes | [repo](https://github.com/fish-devs-web/recipes) | [live preview](https://fish-devs-web.github.io/recipes/)
Etch a sketch | [repo](https://github.com/fish-devs-web/etch-a-sketch) | [live preview](https://fish-devs-web.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)
Calculator | [repo](https://github.com/fish-devs-web/calc) | [live preview](https://th3fishmk.github.io/odin-calc/)
Form | [repo](https://github.com/fish-devs-web/forms) | [live preview](https://fish-devs-web.github.io/forms/)

**This may not be complete list** so please check the [entire repo list](https://github.com/orgs/fish-devs-web/repositories) of  [fish-devs-web](https://github.com/fish-devs-web) to check for any new repo

> Said organization may contain repos for other solutions or practice projects outside TOP.
